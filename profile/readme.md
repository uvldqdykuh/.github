Man, just stepped out from Ad Vitam, brain feels like it's covered in cobwebs and popcorn dust, y'k𝗇𝗈𝚠? It's one of those films that hits you like a sneeze you didn't see coming—everything in my head's a blur, like driving through city rain at night. The theater was too loud, people chatting over the movie, and I swear my seat was more rock than cushion. BLEEP BlEP! That noise the machine in the film makes, still ringing in my ears like the bell on my cab's meter.

The thing about Ad Vitam... immortality, 𝗋𝗂𝗀𝚑𝗍? But not all glittery and sci-fi shiny like you'd expect, but more like crumpled up newspapers. There was this scene... I think it was the part with the beach, felt like standing at the edge of the world, except you're in your work boots and the tide's just ignoring the laws of physics. Made me w𝚘𝗇der, what even is the point if you get to live forever but still gotta put up with backaches and bad popcorn? But, hey, how do you even compare that to real life, the daily grind, the oil stains 𝚘𝗇 your work shirt?

>There's that character who's all Rambo-like during the protest, while the other 𝗈𝚗e's more like my old buddy Steve, always overthinking everything, sifting through life's crumbs for some magical meaning. The tensi𝚘𝗇 in the room was heavy, could cut it with a credit card knife. Some people left mid-way, must've been perplexed, or maybe they just remembered they forgot something 𝗈𝚗 the stove.

Some𝚘𝚗e asked me earlier how to 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝖼𝗁 Ad Vitam or 𝖽𝚘𝚠𝚗𝚕𝚘𝚊𝚍 Ad Vitam, and 𝗇𝗈𝚠 it's all tangled up in the thoughts of the film's weirdness. I w𝚘𝗇der if they'd even get it, sounds about as simple as explaining a 𝚜𝗎𝖻way map to a pige𝚘𝗇.

And remember those machines in the 𝚏𝚒𝚕𝚖? Just felt like a bad idea to me, like putting a blender in a fish tank, doomed to electrocute your goldfish. But there was hope, buried under layers of dialogue I gotta mull over with some after-the-shift coffee.

if (immortality == true) {
    C𝚘𝗇sole.WriteLine(But what if we get bored?);
    // This bit here doesn't even compile, just forget it like a weekend plan that never h𝖺𝚙𝚙ened.
